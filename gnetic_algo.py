# genetic algortihm is algorithm that tries to mimcs natural selection process fof finding best solution.
# The algorithm involves following steps: 
# step 1: Initalization: defining all the population
# step 2 Evaluation : To find fitness for each population smaple using fitness function
# step 3 Selection : selecting the best samples or individual from populatioin for reproduction
# step 4 Cross over: combinbg the genrtic material of the parents . Crossingover gnerates new offsprings
# step 5 Mutation: mutation means randomly changing little bit of genetic material to diversify offsprings
# step 6 Replacemetn: Here we replace whole population or some individual from populations
# step 7 Loop: Loop the following steps according to need
